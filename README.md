# My Vim Settings

This contains my current .vimrc and .vim directory, with all the
settings and plugins I like.

To use it, delete or move your current ``~/.vimrc`` file and ``~/.vim``
directory, if present, then:

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/cwilper/dotvim.git .vim
    ln -s .vim/.vimrc .vimrc
